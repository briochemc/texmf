# texmf

This repo stores all the LaTeX files that I use for every article/project.
In particular, it has the unique .bib file that I will keep using and updating here.

I should check that the .cls and .bst files required by journals are up to date.

tree:
```
texmf
├── bibtex
│   ├── bib
│   │   └── all_my_references_BP.bib
│   └── bst
│       └── agufull08.bst
└── tex
    └── latex
        └── local
            └── agujournal.cls
```
